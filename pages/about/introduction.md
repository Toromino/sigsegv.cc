Welcome to toromino's space!

I am toromino (*"towo"*), a computer science student with a passion for philosophy, public transport, emulation, reverse-engineering, and retro/old hardware. Additionally, I have an interest in human rights issues.

People describe me as temperant, "very kind-hearted", thoughtful, laid-back and "remarkably tall". I prefer to be addressed with "he/him" or "they/them" pronouns.
