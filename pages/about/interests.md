### Hobbies
* Reading

### Philosophy

I am particularly interested in **existentialism**, **proletarian** philosophy as well deontological ethics like **stoicism**.

I used to have an advanced philosophy course in high school. It became my favourite subject and I started reading philosophy in my leisure. Therefore I have been thinking about studying it in university one day.

### Music

**Genre**

* **Space rock**: Relaxing and meditative for me

### Video games

**[NaissanceE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265690/NaissanceE)**: First-person exploration game with a lot of philosophical depth

A friend recommended this to me in 2020. At first it reminded me a bit of Portal, except that you're completely left on your own. I still think about it from time to time.

**Portal series**
